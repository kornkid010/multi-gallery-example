multi-gallery-example
=====================

Demonstrating the possibility of a multi-gallery install with admin panel. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

my ultimate goal for this project is to create an Admin Panel for users to create/delete galleries and add/remove
photos from the UI. 

the first step was getting the color box to automatically add the variable sub-directory created in the 'galleries' 
directory.

changes:

1. Automatically populates the value for "rel" in color box, based on the directories that are created in the
'galleries' folder.
