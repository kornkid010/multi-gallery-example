I am pretty new to PHP and most coding in general. This is my first attempt to make a contribiution to any 
kind of open source projects. I figured the best way to learn would be to branch off of a project and get started. 

please feel free to leave me comments, suggestions, questions, etc... 


multi-gallery-example
=====================

Demonstrating the possibility of a multi-gallery install with admin panel. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

my ultimate goal for this project is to create an Admin Panel for users to create/delete galleries and add/remove
photos from the UI. 

the first step was getting the color box to automatically add the variable sub-directory created in the 'galleries' 
directory.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

changes:
5/13

1. Automatically populates the value for "rel" in color box, based on the directories that are created in the
'galleries' folder. 

5/14

2. fixed a bug where color box wont work if one of the galleries created has a space in the name.
3. added the start to the admin panel. access at http://trend-source.com/multi-gallery-example/admin/ email me if you
want the user/pw to test the gallery creation and upload.
